# **AI-Optimized Reforestation "Digital Twin"**  

## 🌿 **Overview**  
AI-driven reforestation is crucial for combating climate change, but optimizing large-scale seed planting strategies remains a challenge. This project leverages **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** to create a **digital twin** of forest ecosystems. By simulating tree growth under climate scenarios, the RL model learns **optimal drone-based seed dispersal patterns** to maximize carbon sequestration. Real-world validation is performed using **satellite data (NDVI indices)** and **soil sensors**.  

## 🚀 **Key Features**  

### **1. AI-Driven Forest Digital Twin**  
- Uses **RL** to simulate forest growth under changing climate conditions.  
- **GANs** generate synthetic forest imagery for training data augmentation.  
- Incorporates **real-world satellite (Sentinel-2, Landsat)** and **IoT sensor data** for validation.  

### **2. Smart Drone Swarm for Seed Planting**  
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi-based drones with OpenCV for navigation.  
- **AI Optimization:** RL fine-tunes seed dispersion to maximize carbon capture.  
- **Swarm Coordination:** Uses decentralized communication to optimize efficiency.  

### **3. Multi-Source Validation & Feedback Loop**  
- **Satellite NDVI Data:** Verifies vegetation growth trends.  
- **Soil Sensors:** Tracks moisture, nutrients, and early-stage seed success.  
- **Biodiversity Monitoring:** Integrates **iNaturalist API** to assess ecosystem impact.  

## 🔥 **Why This Project Stands Out**  
👉 **Interdisciplinary Innovation** – Combines AI, climate science, and robotics.  
👉 **Scalable & Automated** – AI-driven planning and autonomous drone execution.  
👉 **Real-World Validation** – Not just a simulation, but tested with real-world data.  
👉 **Open-Source & Expandable** – Community-driven improvements encouraged.
